# Using partially filled arrays with a sentinel value

## Step 1
Examine and run the code to see how it functions. Add a comment to the code each time the **grades** array is used, describing what that line of code is doing. You should have at least **6** comments added. Why is the use of this array called a **"partially filled array with a sentinel value"? What is the value of the sentinel?**

## Step 2
Add statements to also calculate the average of the elements inputted and display the average to the screen.

## Step 3
Also determine the highest grade and the lowest grade entered.
